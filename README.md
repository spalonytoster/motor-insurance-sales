# MOTOR Insurance

Letter to myself from the future.

This is one of the first prototypes for possible structure and flow of this Motor Sales Tool.

My arch assumptions are in /docs/project-overview-v2.md

Main idea is that whole sales process consists of three main phases:
1. Data procurement
2. Offering
3. Checkout

Those phases are governed by kind of a process manager called Customer Journey.
